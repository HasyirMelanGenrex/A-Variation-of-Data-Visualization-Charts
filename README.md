# Data Visualization
In this project i tried to make variation of existing visualization that i've already done before on other projects

# Heart Attack Dataset
The Heart Attack Dataset is a dataset consist of 13 attributes, 
1. Age: Age (in years)
2. Sex: gender (1 = male; 0 = female)
3. ChestPain: Chest Pain type -- 1: typical angina (all criteria present) -- 2: atypical angina (two of three criteria satisfied) -- 3: non-anginal pain (less than one criteria satisfied) -- 4: asymptomatic (none of the criteria are satisfied)
4. Restbps: Resting Blood pressure (in mmHg, upon admission to the hospital)
5. Chol: serum cholesterol in mg/dL
6. Fbs: fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dL (likely to be diabetic) 1 = true; 0 = false
7. RestECG: Resting electrocardiogram results -- Value 0: normal -- Value 1: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV) -- Value 2: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria
8. MaxHR: Greatest number of beats per minute your heart can possibly reach during all-out strenuous exercise.
9. Exang: exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
10. Oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest (in mm, achieved by subtracting the lowest ST segment points during exercise and rest)
11. Slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment, ST-T abnormalities are considered to be a crucial indicator for identifying presence of ischaemia -- Value 1: upsloping -- Value 2: flat -- Value 3: downsloping
12. Ca: number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy. Major cardial vessels are as goes: aorta, superior vena cava, inferior vena cava, pulmonary artery (oxygen-poor blood --> lungs), pulmonary veins (oxygen-rich blood --> heart), and coronary arteries (supplies blood to heart tissue).
13. AHD: 0 = normal; 1 = fixed defect (heart tissue can't absorb thallium both under stress and in rest); 2 = reversible defect (heart tissue is unable to absorb thallium only under the exercise portion of the test) 14.AHD: 0 = no disease, 1 = disease. All this attributes would describe someone that has a heart desease or not.

# India Food Price Dataset
The India Food Price dataset is a dataset consist of 7 Food ingridient from india as a time-series. Such as, Chickpeas, Oil, Mustard, Potatoes, Rice, Sugar, Wheat, Onion and a date that shows how much the price was during certain times.
